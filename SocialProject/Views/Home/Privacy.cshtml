                                             <p>Last updated: January 28th, 2022. You can see past versions of this policy <a href="https://github.com/classdojo/policies/blob/master/privacy.md">here</a> on Github.</p>
                                             <p>We believe you should always know what data we collect from you, how we use it, and that you should have meaningful control over both. We want to empower users to make the best decisions about the information that they share with us. In fact, we made a <a href="https://vid.ly/6l7i1p">short video</a> for students that highlights the most important details in our Privacy Policy that they should know about. We offer a <a href="https://static.classdojo.com/docs/DPA/2021-05-classdojo-student-data-dpa.pdf">Student Data Privacy Addendum</a>, an agreement we enter into with schools or districts that further describes our duties, responsibilities, and commitments with respect to <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_63d91d2f-19b7-44bd-8373-649884e75fca">Student Data</a> that we collect or receive.</p>
                                             <p>This Privacy Policy applies solely to the ClassDojo Services (defined below) and does not apply to the informational website located at <a href="../index.html">https://www.classdojo.com</a> (the “ClassDojo Website”).

                                             <p><strong>Data Retention</strong>: We will not retain student <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d">personal information</a> for any longer than is necessary for <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_0f871510-2886-46eb-9bb4-e7ae17080447">educational purposes</a> and legal obligations, or to provide the Service for which we receive or collect the student personal information. </p>
                                             <p>We protect students with our industry-leading 2-Tier Student Data Protection Policy:

                                             <p>We make clear commitments, consistent with our obligations under the <a href="https://studentprivacypledge.org/">Student Privacy Pledge</a>, regarding how we handle student data in the event of a change to our organization (such as a merger) where personal information that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred or acquired.  Consistent with the Student Privacy Pledge and applicable state and federal laws, in connection with such a change to our organization, this Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this Privacy Policy (unless you give consent to a new policy).

                                             <p>ClassDojo is a communication platform that helps teachers encourage students in class and engage parents and other teachers. Teachers use ClassDojo to give students encouragement (or “<a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125">Feedback Points</a>”) for showing critical skills or strengths - ones like persistence, critical thinking, teamwork, and leadership. Teachers can also post assignments using the Activities feature for students to complete on ClassDojo <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046897531-How-to-Assign-an-Activity-to-a-Group-or-Individual-Students-within-a-Class#web">(“Activities”)</a>. They can use the ClassDojo Apps or the ClassDojo Platform - if multiple devices are used, they will all sync with each other. Teachers can instantly message parents with text-based messages, pictures, videos, and stickers, <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360046897531-How-to-Assign-an-Activity-to-a-Group-or-Individual-Students-within-a-Class#web">post assignments and Activities </a>, and <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730309-What-is-ClassDojo-Messaging-">privately message parents</a> or send group messages. Teachers can also add posts to <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103">Class Story</a>, <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103">School Story</a> and individual <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360009884732-What-is-ClassDojo-Portfolios-and-How-Does-it-Work-">Student Portfolios</a>.</p>
                                             <p>Parents get to be a part of their child’s classroom experiences and may also <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004708883-How-does-my-child-log-into-their-student-account-at-home-#web">set up their child’s account</a> on ClassDojo for use in school and at home. Parents may optionally purchase <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732">Premium Features</a> to help encourage their children at home. Parents can also comment on Class Stories and School Stories. Parents can only view their own children’s Feedback Points (if elected to be shown by their child’s teacher) and Portfolios, not those of any other students. Parents can also message with other parents. </p>
                                             <p>Students can have their own Student Account to view feedback given by teachers and parents, and perform additional tasks, such as <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360022857031-How-to-Post-to-a-Student-Portfolio#web">posting to their portfolio</a>, <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360024555511-Where-are-Assigned-Portfolio-Activities-How-Can-I-Respond-#web">responding to assigned Activities</a> (“Student Activity Responses”), commenting on Class Story or Portfolio posts (teacher and student comments collectively “Portfolio Comments”), and <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/202739645-Customize-Your-Monster#web">customizing their ClassDojo avatar</a>.  Children may also use ClassDojo in the non-school context with their Outside School Child Account - for use with the parents and other parent-approved uses, including with certain Premium Features. </p>
                                             <p>In order to have a Student Account or Outside School Child Account created, children will need to either (1) have the Student Account created at school by their teacher (only after the teacher represents to ClassDojo that they have obtained any necessary <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986">parental consent</a> which allows them to then <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004688443-How-Students-can-Log-into-ClassDojo-#web">log in</a> or (2) create their own account, such as with a username and password (which will require parental consent); or (3) have their parents create their Student Account or Outside School Child Account at home after we have obtained <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046">parental consent</a>. Any at-home points (“Home Points”) and content uploaded through use in an Outside School Child Account are not viewable by the child’s teacher or other students, but the customization of the monster through Premium Features may show up in the child’s Student Account and viewable in school (e.g., by teachers, school leaders, and other students).</p>
                                             <p>School Leaders also play a meaningful role on ClassDojo. They can share notes, events, photos, and videos on School Story; only teachers, parents, and students connected to classes in the school can see these posts. School leaders can also create classes and events, share classes with teachers to give feedback to students, post to Class Story and Portfolios, add Portfolio Comments, message with parents, and see <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/207813176-What-can-School-Leaders-see-and-do-#web">Highlights</a> of their school.</p>

We have also created <a href="../transparency/index.html">this chart</a> with the detailed categories of personal information we collect from each user type, including the sources from which the information was collected, the business purpose for which the information was collected, and the third parties with whom we share or disclose personal information for a business purpose.</p>

                                             <p>We ask for and collect the following <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d">personal information</a> about you when you use the Service. This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, for our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service, and to allow us to comply with our legal obligations. Without it, we may not be able to provide you with all the requested services.</p>
                                             <p>There are currently five categories of users on our Service: teachers, school leaders, parents, students, and Outside School Child Users who use the Services outside of school, including with our Premium Features. Additionally, as a non-logged-in visitor to the ClassDojo Website, you may provide personal information to us as set forth in our separate <a href="../website-privacy/index.html">ClassDojo Website Privacy Policy</a>. We describe the information collected from students and Outside School Child Users in the “How We Protect Children’s Personal Information” section <a href="#what-information-does-classdojo-collect">above</a>; for other users, we collect and store the following types of information from each type of user:</p>

                                                   <p><strong>Account Sign-up and Profile Information:</strong> To create a ClassDojo account as a teacher, school leader, or parent, you may be asked to provide some basic information such as your first and last name, email address, telephone number, password, and an optional profile photo. If a student’s teacher is creating the Student Account on behalf of the student, they will provide the student’s name, grade, and possibly date of birth. This same information is also used to create the Student Account on the parent’s behalf (the parent does not currently need to provide any additional <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d">personal information</a> of their child if a parent is connected to the school with the unique parent code). If the parent is creating their child’s account and is not connected to their child’s school, they may provide additional information about their child (such as first and last name and date of birth). Teacher, school leader, and parent profiles may be viewed by other teachers and school leaders in the same school as well as parents connected to the school or class; however, no teacher, parent, or student profile is made available or visible to the general public through the functionality of our Service.</p>

If you are using the Service as a teacher, School Leader, or parent, we may ask you for permission to collect and store your precise geolocation information to help us identify schools located nearby for you, including to help connect your parent account to your child’s school (e.g., our <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360050943651-Request-to-Connect-to-Your-Child-s-Teacher#web">“Find a Teacher”</a> feature).

Alternatively, teachers can also upload a spreadsheet to the Service with the student’s first and last names or choose students from the <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210560366">School Directory</a> if they are already in a class of a verified teacher within the school. If a teacher opts to share the classes they set up on ClassDojo with other teachers or school leaders in their school or outside their school, such as teachers they co-teach with, then those teachers can also see that class’s information, excluding parent-teacher messages which remain private between one parent and one teacher.</p>

As a parent, school leader, or teacher, you can also invite others to join the Service or share certain content (e.g., as a parent within Premium Features) by utilizing your own native mobile application functionality through the ClassDojo App, for example, by email or SMS. We will collect and store the email and phone numbers you provide with these requests and will also treat this as <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d">personal information</a> in accordance with this Privacy Policy.

Additionally, as a teacher, you can send messages to other teachers and school leaders. As a parent, you can also message with your child’s teacher through ClassDojo Messaging as well as through comments on Portfolios, Class Story, and School Story posts and can also message other parents that are connected to your child’s school. As a teacher, school leader, or parent, your name and profile photo may be displayed to the person with whom you are messaging and on comments you leave on a Class Story or School Story, and if you are a teacher or school leader, you may receive a ‘read receipt’ showing how many parents have read your message.. Additionally, parents may elect to turn on a feature that allows them to know if a teacher has read their messages and may similarly receive a ‘read receipt’ telling them the teacher has read the message.  </p>

                                             <p>Please be aware that by using a broadcast messaging feature, such as <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103">Class Story</a> or <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/211889103">School Story</a>, any messages, photos, videos, comments or other content shared can be viewed by all parents, students (whose parents have provided verifiable <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046">parental consent</a> to ClassDojo (or the student’s teacher has represented they have obtained any necessary <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986">parental consent</a>, and teachers and school leaders that are members of that class or school, respectively. In the case that a photo or video is shared in a broadcast message, Class Story, or School Story showing a student who does not want photos taken of him/her (or whose parent does not want photos taken of him/her), or if any user needs to otherwise <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360040332952">report any abuse</a> or inappropriate content on a Class Story or School Story that has not been addressed by the connected teacher or school, they may do so by emailing at <a href="mailto:&#x73;&#x61;&#102;&#101;&#116;&#121;&#x40;&#x63;&#108;&#x61;&#x73;&#x73;&#100;&#111;&#x6a;&#x6f;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;">&#x73;&#x61;&#102;&#101;&#116;&#121;&#x40;&#x63;&#108;&#x61;&#x73;&#x73;&#100;&#111;&#x6a;&#x6f;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#109;</a> to remove it, subject to any photo or record being deemed an “education record” under FERPA. If a photo or video is considered an “education record” you will need to first contact your child’s school to request removal. For more information on when photos or videos are considered an “education record” please see the Department of Education’s guidance <a href="https://studentprivacy.ed.gov/faq/faqs-photos-and-videos-under-ferpa">here</a>. We will store messages, including those on Class Story, School Story, and Portfolios, and any content sent with the messages (e.g., photos), to provide the Service, and to help teachers and school leaders keep a log of their communications with parents.

Once the teacher has approved the student-uploaded portfolio post, the Portfolio Comments will then be viewable to the child’s parent (but may have been edited by the student or teacher prior to being shown to the parent). Prior to this approval, any Portfolio Comments between the teacher and the student can’t be viewed by the student’s parent, but any connected parent will receive a notice indicating that the Portfolio Comments feature is being utilized by their child’s teacher and can discuss the use of Portfolio Comments with their child’s teacher. </p>

Once a teacher publishes such Activities, they can be viewed by their students, other teachers connected to their class, and by other teachers that ClassDojo may share with pursuant to the <a href="../terms/index.html">Terms of Service</a> (unless a teacher opts-out), but they will not be viewable by the general public.. Parents can also download certain content from a Class Story or School Story or access advanced reporting and additional downloads, by purchasing our Premium Features, but must first confirm that they are giving us consent to use any content that might be deemed an “education record” or “Student Data” in this manner.

                                             <p>As a teacher or school leader, you can customize a list of feedback types that you want to encourage or recognize using <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125">Feedback Points</a>, such as persistence, teamwork, or leadership. These Feedback Points cannot be viewed by the general public through our Service. A student’s Feedback Points can only be viewed on ClassDojo by that student, the teacher who awarded them, that student’s connected parent account(s) (if the teacher <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/201892729-I-Can-t-See-My-Child-s-Report">has elected</a> to show them to the parent), and other teachers or school leaders the class is shared with. If the teacher chooses to display totals to the class, other students in the class may be able to see each other’s aggregated totals (but not individual Feedback Points). </p>
                                             <p>Home Points </p>
                                             <p>Parents are given a limited number of Home Points for use at home but can also choose to customize and award additional <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732">Home Points </a> to their children through the <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732">Premium Features</a> functionality. These Home Points can also be used to react to activities occurring within their child’s class. The Home Points may be combined with the Feedback Points earned in school and may be used by the child at the <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/6490411159053-What-is-the-ClassDojo-Shop-">ClassDojo Shop</a>. These Home Points are only viewable by the connected parent account(s) and the child using their student account or Outside School Children’s Account and are not viewable by the child’s teacher or other students. For all points (Home Points or Feedback Points in school) and the reports generated that show these reports, we also collect product events (e.g., the number of points given, skill, which reports are viewed, etc.).  These are collected to provide the Services, including for internal analysis on product usage and quality.  We may also use it to track progress in the Service, and for sending push or email notifications to the parent’s, teacher’s, or student’s device to encourage them to take certain actions in the ClassDojo Service. </p>

Parents can then give Home Points for a specific skill to contribute towards the Skill and, once a Skill is completed, a parent may award a Reward (and may give Rewards in connection with other activities as well).  Rewards and Skills given at home can only be accessed through the parent account or the child’s Outside School Child’s Account; teachers and other students are not able to see these Rewards or Skills or to contribute points to them.  We collect product events (e.g., the value of the Rewards or Skills, whether a parent has created a goal, the number of Rewards or Skills given, and Reward or Goal name) from the parent.  These are collected for internal analysis on product usage and quality.  We may also use it to track progress in the app, and for sending push and email notifications to a parent’s email or device to encourage them to take actions within the Service (such as creating a skill). </p>

We will collect additional information, such as your child’s age, in order to suggest a routine for morning, afternoon, and evening activities for your child at home (such as “out of bed”, “mealtime”, “quiet time”).   You can then modify these to add additional skills and point values.  We collect product events (e.g. the value of the Rewards or Goals, whether a parent has created a goal, the number of Rewards or Goals given, and Reward or Goal name) from the parent.

You will then be required to use either your Apple ID, Google Account, or other payment method to purchase the Premium Features. Prior to allowing your child (or children) access to the Premium Features within their Outside School Child Account (or if any children’s personal information, educational records or Student Data are utilized in the Premium Features that previously relied on “<a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/210411986">school consent</a>”), we will also require <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004762046">parental consent</a>.  Please see our <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/360018137732-ClassDojo-Beyond-School-FAQ">FAQ</a> for more information. We do not collect any credit card information directly from parents to purchase Premium Features, nor is any credit card data passed back to us from any payment method you used to purchase the Premium Features. Please see <a href="../third-party-service-providers/index.html">here</a> for a list of what information we receive from third-parties in connection with your payment method as well as what purchase events and analytics we track through our service providers in connection with your purchases.

                                             <p>When you use the Service, we (or our <a href="../third-party-service-providers/index.html">service providers</a>) may use various technologies that automatically record or collect certain information, including personal information, from your browser or your device about the services you use and how you use them. This information is necessary for the adequate performance of the contract between you and us, to enable us to comply with legal obligations and given our legitimate interest in being able to provide and improve the Service. For example, this could include the frequency and duration of your visits to ClassDojo (similar to TV ratings that indicate how many people watched a particular show). If you use ClassDojo on different devices, we may link the information we collect from those different devices to help us provide a consistent Service across your different devices. If we do combine any automatically-collected information with personal information, we will treat the combined information as personal information, and it will be protected as per this Privacy Policy. </p>

We (or our service providers) may also use these technologies (never in student logged in areas of our Service) in connection with advertising of our Service that may appear on other sites or in connection with advertising their products outside of our Service (e.g., if you view an embedded YouTube video player on our Service, YouTube may place cookies or similar technologies on your browser when you play the video off our site). We don’t allow these third-parties to advertise directly on our Service (i.e. such as when an advertiser would bid to place an advertisement directly on a platform such as Facebook), but we may serve contextually relevant advertising for third-party products and services ourselves that we believe may be of interest to you (e.g., our co-created content with <a href="https://ideas.classdojo.com/b/mindfulness">Yale University on Mindfulness</a>).

                                             <p>Like many services, ClassDojo (or our service providers) uses both local storage and cookies and other similar technologies to analyze trends, gather demographic information about our users, understand your engagement with the Service, administer the Service, tailor the Service for you, and to help the Service work better for you - for example, by remembering your language preferences.

                                                   <p><strong>Device information:</strong> We collect device-specific information such as your device type, device brand, operating system, hardware version and settings, device settings, file and software names and types, battery and signal strength, and device identifiers. We may also collect device event information such as crashes, system activity, browser type, browser language, the date and time of your request and referral URL. This helps us measure how the Service is performing, improve ClassDojo for you on your particular device, and send you push notifications if you’ve opted in to receive them.</p>

This number and information about your installation (for example, the operating system type and application version number) may be sent to ClassDojo when you install or uninstall that application, such as when you install the ClassDojo App, when you open the application, or when that application periodically contacts our servers, such as for automatic updates. Additionally, we may receive application state and crash log information which will help us debug and improve the ClassDojo App.</p>

We may use your IP address and share it with third parties to help diagnose problems with our servers, for security purposes, to manage the Service, to enhance the Services based on usage pattern data and, for analytics and for advertising. Third party sharing of IP address information for analytics and advertising is not allowed for student and Outside School Child Users.</p>

                                                <li><strong>Location information:</strong> When you use our Service, we may collect and process information about your geographic location, for example, based on your IP address. We collect both coarse (i.e., city-level) location data and precise location data. If we request precise geolocation information (“precise” meaning sufficient to identify street name and name of city or town) from you (such as when a teacher or parent is searching for a school), we ask for your explicit opt-in permission. We <strong>never</strong> request precise geolocation data from students or Outside School Child Users. From all users, if they upload photos or videos from their computer, or from their phone&#39;s camera roll directly, as opposed to choosing to use ClassDojo’s own application camera, we collect what the device sends us. If the device sends us Exchangeable Image File Format (EXIF data) (metadata contained within the image file - e.g. camera model, lighting conditions, and location (if enabled)) this can contain location data (and may contain precise location data). We strip all EXIF data, including the location information, from the photo before it is viewed by other users (e.g., the parent in Messaging).  If a user accesses and uses our mobile camera within the application itself, the camera has been configured so as to not collect any EXIF data, therefore the EXIF information is not stored (as opposed to if you use your device’s own camera roll).</li>

                                             <p>We will not store or track your precise device location on an ongoing basis or without your permission. We do not share precise geolocation data with third-parties, other than our <a href="#service-providers">service providers</a> as necessary to provide the Service. If you no longer wish to allow us to track your location information, you may opt-out at any time by turning it off at the device level.</p>

                                             <p>Other Users You Share and Communicate with on ClassDojo: No teacher, school leader, parent, or student profiles are made available to the general public through our Service. Furthermore, students cannot share their <a href="#information-you-provide-to-us">account information</a> or portfolio with anyone on ClassDojo, outside of their parents, teachers (including those at other schools), or school leaders. If you are a teacher, school leader, or a parent, you may choose to share information or content through the Service with other ClassDojo teachers, school leaders, students, or parents - for example, things like your account information, <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/204422125">Feedback Points</a> awarded to students you teach (if you are a teacher or school leader) or to your children (if you are a parent) or other information you share with teachers, school leaders, or parents you are communicating with through <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203730309">ClassDojo Messaging</a>, Class Story, School Story, Portfolios, or our other collaboration features.

                                             <p>Please keep in mind that information (including personal Information or children&#39;s personal information) or content that you voluntarily disclose to others - including to other ClassDojo users you interact with through the Service (such as messages you might send other users or other teachers and school leaders you collaborate with) - can be viewed, copied, stored, and used by the people you share it with. We cannot control the actions of people with whom you choose to share information and we are not responsible for the collection, use, or disclosure of such information or content by others.</p>
                                             <p>Third-Party Integrations on our Service: When, as a teacher, school leader, student, or parent, you use third-party apps, websites, or other services that use, or are integrated with, our Service, they may receive information about what you post or share. For example, when you share a <a href="https://ideas.classdojo.com/">Big Ideas activity</a> on Twitter or Facebook, these services receive the information that you share through this functionality and information that you are sharing from ClassDojo. Please see <a href="#third-party-services">here</a> for more information on third-party services. Please <a href="../third-party-service-providers/index.html">see here</a> for a list of third-party app integrations on our Service and the ClassDojo Website.</p>
                                             <p>Service Providers: We do work with vendors, service providers, and other partners to help us provide the Service by performing tasks on our behalf. These service providers may be located inside or outside of the European Economic Area (“EEA”). We may need to share or provide information (including personal information) to them to help them perform these business functions, for example sending emails on our behalf, database management services, database hosting, providing customer support software, and security. We may also authorize these third-party companies to collect information on our behalf. These providers have limited access to your personal information to perform these tasks on our behalf and are contractually bound to protect and use it only for the purpose for which it was disclosed. Additionally, these partners and service providers must adhere to confidentiality and security obligations in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy. Please see <a href="../third-party-service-providers/index.html">here</a> for a list of the third-parties we work with to provide the Service and the ClassDojo Website.</p>
                                             <p>Social Media Platforms: Where permissible according to applicable law, we may share certain limited personal information with social media platforms (such as Google or Facebook) and other websites, applications or partners, to generate leads, drive traffic to our websites or otherwise market and advertise our products or services on those websites or applications (this will never include personal information of students). These processing activities are based on our legitimate interest in undertaking marketing activities to offer you products and services that may be of your interest. These social media platforms with which we may share your personal information are not controlled or supervised by ClassDojo. Therefore, any questions regarding how your social media platform processes your personal information should be directed to such provider.</p>
                                             <p>Analytics Services: We use analytics services, including mobile analytics software, to help us understand and improve how the Service is being used. These services may collect, store and use information in order to help us understand things like how often you use the Service, the events that occur within the application, usage, performance data, and from where the application was downloaded. A current list of analytics providers that we use is located <a href="../third-party-service-providers/index.html">here</a>.</p>
                                             <p>Aggregated Information and Non-Identifying Information:  We may share aggregated information (information about our users that we combine together so that it no longer identifies or references an individual user) and other <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#Deidentified">de-identified</a> or non-personally identifiable information (such as statistics about visitors, traffic and usage patterns), including with users, partners or the press in order to, for example, demonstrate how ClassDojo is used, spot industry trends, or to provide marketing materials for ClassDojo. Any aggregated information and non-personalized information shared this way will not contain any personal information.</p>
                                             <p>Legal Requirements:  We may disclose information, including personal information, if we have a good faith belief that doing so is necessary to comply with the law, such as complying with a subpoena or other legal process. We may need to disclose personal information where, in good faith, we think it is necessary to protect the rights, property, or safety of ClassDojo, our employees, our community, or others, or to prevent violations of our <a href="../terms/index.html">Terms of Service</a> or other agreements.  This includes, without limitation, responding to law enforcement and government requests. Where appropriate, we may notify users about the legal requests, unless (i) providing notice is prohibited by the legal process itself, by court order we receive, or by applicable law; (ii) we believe that providing notice would be futile, ineffective, create a risk of injury or bodily harm to an individual or group, or create or increase a risk of fraud upon ClassDojo, or its users. In instances where we comply with legal requests without notice for these reasons, we will attempt to notify that user about the request after the fact where appropriate and where we determine in good faith that we are no longer prevented from doing so.</p>
                                             <p>Fraud and Security Protection:  We may share information to assist with security operations for scheduled penetration testing, auditing, and continuous improvement of our security practices, including without limitation, exchanging information with other companies and organizations for fraud protection. Authorized parties of the information would comply with our current privacy and security policies.</p>
                                             <p>Sharing with ClassDojo Companies:  Over time, ClassDojo may grow and reorganize. We may share your personal information with affiliates such as a parent company, subsidiaries, joint venture partners, or other companies that we control or that are under common control with us, in which case we will require those companies to agree to use your personal information in a way that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.</p>
                                             <p>Change of control: The <a href="https://studentprivacypledge.org/">Student Privacy Pledge</a> requires us (and all pledgers) to commit to how we handle data in the event of a change to our organizations such that all or a portion of ClassDojo or its assets are acquired by or merged with a third-party, or in any other situation where <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/115004741703#h_2843be58-eb16-4535-8579-138369598e4d">personal information</a> that we have collected from users would be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by that third-party. Consistent with the Student Privacy Pledge and applicable state and federal laws, in connection with such a change to our organization, if any, this Privacy Policy will continue to apply to your information, and any acquirer would only be able to handle your personal information as per this policy (unless you give consent to a new policy). We will provide you with notice of an acquisition within thirty (30) days following the completion of such a transaction, by posting on our homepage, or by email to your email address that you provided to us. If you do not consent to the use of your personal information by such a successor company, subject to applicable law, you may request its deletion from the company. We may also make information, including personal information, available to a potential investor or purchaser (or their advisors) in advance of any such transaction completion. </p>

Outages, attacks, human error, system failure, unauthorized use, or other factors may compromise the security of user information at any time. If we learn of a security breach, we will attempt to notify you electronically (subject to any applicable laws and school reporting requirements) so that you can take appropriate protective steps; for example, we may post a notice on our homepage (<a href="../index.html">www.classdojo.com</a>) or elsewhere on the Service, and may send email to you at the email address you have provided to us. Depending on where you live, you may have a legal right to receive notice of a security breach in writing.

                                             <p><strong>Managing Your Information</strong>: If you have registered for an account on ClassDojo, you may update, correct, or delete some of your profile information or your preferences at any time by logging into your account on ClassDojo and accessing your account settings page.

You may also, at any time, update, correct, or delete certain personal information that you have provided to us by contacting us at <a href="mailto:&#112;&#x72;&#105;&#118;&#x61;&#x63;&#x79;&#64;&#99;&#108;&#97;&#115;&#115;&#x64;&#x6f;&#x6a;&#111;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;">&#112;&#x72;&#105;&#118;&#x61;&#x63;&#x79;&#64;&#99;&#108;&#97;&#115;&#115;&#x64;&#x6f;&#x6a;&#111;&#x2e;&#99;&#x6f;&#x6d;</a> from the email used to create your ClassDojo account or by following the instructions <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/requests/new?ticket_form_id=360000061571">here</a> once you are signed in to your ClassDojo account.

Information that you have shared with others, others have shared about you, or content other users may have copied and stored, is not part of your account and may not be deleted when you delete your account. Additionally, please note that even if your account is deleted, messages or content shared between teachers and parents (or Portfolio Comments and content shared between teachers and students) are retained to assist schools with various recordkeeping or compliance obligations. This includes, for example, any content uploaded, including photos and videos, or comments on Messaging, Portfolios, Class Story, or School Story, which we consider messaging between parents and teachers (or teachers and students). Additionally, some content within a Student Account, such as Student Activity Responses and other content uploaded by the student and/or teacher, will be kept after the Student Account is deleted for school legal compliance reasons (e.g., maintenance of “education records” under FERPA or “student records” under various state student privacy laws). If you would like this content deleted, please first put in a request to your (or your child’s) school. If the school determines that the request should be implemented, the school may submit the request to ClassDojo by emailing <a href="mailto:&#112;&#x72;&#x69;&#118;&#97;&#x63;&#121;&#x40;&#x63;&#108;&#x61;&#x73;&#115;&#x64;&#x6f;&#x6a;&#x6f;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;">&#112;&#x72;&#x69;&#118;&#97;&#x63;&#121;&#x40;&#x63;&#108;&#x61;&#x73;&#115;&#x64;&#x6f;&#x6a;&#x6f;&#x2e;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;</a>.

For example, if we suspend a ClassDojo account for fraud or safety reasons, we may retain certain information from that account to prevent that user from opening a new account in the future.

You can, of course, <a href="#how-can-i-delete-my-account">delete your account</a> at any time.

If you choose to provide such information during registration, you are giving ClassDojo the permission to store and use such information already associated with your Authentication Service in a manner consistent with this Privacy Policy. The current list of Authentication Services that we use is listed <a href="https://classdojo.zendesk.com/hc/en-us/articles/203732189">here</a>. Please note, that when using an Authentication Service for registering a student (or if a student is directly using their own Authentication Service), ClassDojo will not request more information from the Authentication Service than name and email address unless specifically requested or chosen to be passed by the teacher or school to ClassDojo. We will only use the email collected from student users for the purposes of login and account management. The Authentication Service may collect certain other information from you in your use of that particular service (such as G-Suite for Education). 
                                                You may revoke ClassDojo’s access to your account on any Authentication Service at any time by updating the appropriate settings in the account preferences of the respective Authentication Service. You should check your privacy settings on each Authentication Service to understand and change the information sent to us through each Authentication Service. Please review each Authentication Service’s terms of use and privacy policies carefully before using their services and connecting to our Service. Your use of Authentication Service is subject to the applicable third-party terms and privacy policies.
